# :rocket: Frozen Facts Center

Welcome to the Frozen Facts Center repository! This project serves as a comprehensive data
analytics platform built on freely available data from the official NHL API.

The repository is organized into four primary sections:

1. [Cloud Infrastructure](./stacks/README.md) (details below)
2. [Data Models for Transformation](./transform/README.md)
3. [Web Application](./board/README.md)
4. [Research Notebooks](./notebooks/README.md)

## :construction_worker_man: Setup

We leverage AWS CDK to define AWS services for data storage and transformation.

The project follows a standard Python project setup. Upon initialization, a virtualenv is created
within the project, stored under the `.venv` directory. To set up the virtualenv, assuming
a `python3` (or `python` for Windows) executable in your path with access to the `venv` package,
follow these steps:

1. Run `python3 -m venv .venv` in the project root directory.
2. Activate the virtualenv: `. .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Synthesize the CloudFormation template for AWS CDK code: `cdk synth`

### :envelope: Deployment

Before deployment, some useful commands include:

- `cdk ls`: list all stacks in the app
- `cdk diff`: compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk docs`: open CDK documentation

To deploy all stacks, run `cdk deploy`. For deploying a specific stack, use the stack ID,
such as `cdk deploy StorageStack|ComputeStack|TransformStack`.

## :floppy_disk: Data

> No guarantees are made regarding the quality of the data. NHL data might contain known issues
> and biases.

Production data is downloaded and saved to AWS S3 via
the [`download-raw-games` lambda function](./stacks/lambdas/download-raw-games/).
Triggered daily, it fetches details about the previous night's games.

For historical data, follow these steps to download to local disk within the Docker container
defined in the [`notebooks/` folder](./notebooks/), then manually upload to AWS S3:

```bash
python /usr/src/app/src/extract/teams.py
python /usr/src/app/src/extract/players.py
python /usr/src/app/src/extract/games.py
```
